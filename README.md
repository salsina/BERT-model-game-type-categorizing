# BERT-model-game-type-categorizing
using bert model and fine tuning the model, I have trained the most efficient model for categorizing games and applications based on their persian description

For the fine tuing part, different hyper parameters are tested such as:
  1) word-piece, XLNET tokenizers
  2) parseBert, multilingualBert model
  3) learning rate
  4) batch size
  5) epoch size

The finall accuracy on test data is 71%
